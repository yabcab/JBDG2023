MUST:
-use controller support (made to be played on xbox via uwp)
-NEVER update from this specific beta version
-make it quickly
-NPCs with strange funny dialogue
-Roomnames w/ cryptic message embeded. Find it, jarlatag...

WOULD BE COOL:
-hidden challenge room with some one the secret message embedded in it
-make ufra and probably some others do funny voicework for the game
