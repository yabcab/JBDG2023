HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!
Hello! Disclaimer!

This birthday game (developed March 3rd - June [placehold]),
is probably quite rushed in some areas! Be aware of that! 
A lot of work has gone into making sure this gift can 
be the best it can be, but some parts of it may be 
janky or rough around the edges due to time constraints. 
I will probably make a small update sometime afterward 
that fixes these issues. Thank you for being the best 
friend i could ever ask for, and thank you for reading!
